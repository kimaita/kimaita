# Hi, I'm KimaitaðŸ™ƒ
_Welcome to my GitHub_

I'm a Junior **Data Engineer** who also dabbles in **data analysis**, a bit of **web development**, some **embedded programming** and a little **Android**. I have a background in Electrical & Electronics Engineering (Telecommunications) but my passion has always been software and computer engineering.  
I am currently working on the [alx](https://www.alxafrica.com) Software Engineering program covering [C](https://github.com/kimaita/alx-low_level_programming), [DevOps](https://github.com/kimaita/alx-system_engineering-devops), [Python and Web Development](https://github.com/kimaita/alx-higher_level_programming) - with a focus on Backend development.
